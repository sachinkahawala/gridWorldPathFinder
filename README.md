# gridWorldPathFinder
 Optimal path finding in a 2D grid with reinforcement learning.
Finding the optimal pollicy for a agent that has 4 possible actions including up, down, left and right.

The grid may contain obstacles where the agent wonâ€™t be able to penetrate through. Which will be marked in green in the GUI.
Implementation assumes that each action is deterministic, that is, the agent will go where it intends to go. For instance, when the agent decides to take action up at (2, 0), it will land in (1, 0). The tragets are the ultimate goals of the agent, it will try to arrive at the nearest target with minimum steps as possible. The targets are shown in blue in the GUI.

If no targets are reachable it will try to arrive at the closest arrivalbe cell in the grid. For each cell best policy (which actionss to take in order to arive at the closest target) will be shown after calculating the optimal path.
